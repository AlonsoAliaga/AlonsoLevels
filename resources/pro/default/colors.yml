#Welcome to colors.yml! This file will allow you to change colors for every level or range.
#Make sure you follow the format to make it work correctly. HEX colors are supported.
#This is the default color.
Default: "&7"
#These colors will be used for each level.
#This was especially made to easily create colors for ranges.
#According to default configuration it would work like this:
#If you have any level lower than 10, you'll get Default color.
#If you have any level between 10 and 25 (exclusive, 25 not included) you'll get "&a" color.
#If you have any level between 25 and 50 (exclusive, 50 not included) you'll get "&3" color.
#An so on.. That's how it works.
